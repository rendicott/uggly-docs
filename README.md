# uggly-docs
There will need to be a lot of docs for the [uggly](https://github.com/rendicott/uggly) TUI over the wire protocol. This will likely be comprised of "Getting Started" guides, Technical Reference docs, code samples, etc. Since I'm not sure how I want to deliver the content (HTML, CMS, Markdown, SSG, or within the [uggly client](https:/github.com/rendicott/uggly-client) itself) I want to start writing the docs and playing around with different delivery schemes. This repo is for that.
